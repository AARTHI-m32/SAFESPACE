    <h3>Fire Safety Tips</h3><br/>
    <img src="./images/fire.jpg"/> 
    <h4>Before a Fire:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Install Smoke Alarms:</strong> Ensure smoke alarms are installed in key areas such as the kitchen, bedrooms, and hallways. Test them monthly and replace batteries at least once a year.</li>
        <li><strong>Plan an Escape Route:</strong> Create and practice a fire escape plan with all members of your household. Designate a meeting spot outside your home.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep Flammable Materials Safe:</strong> Store flammable materials like gasoline, cleaning agents, and paints in proper containers and away from heat sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Fire Extinguishers:</strong> Place fire extinguishers in accessible locations, especially in the kitchen. Learn how to use them properly.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>During a Fire:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stay Low and Crawl:</strong> Smoke rises, so stay low to the ground and crawl to safety if necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Open Hot Doors:</strong> Before opening a door, feel it with the back of your hand. If it's hot, don't open it. Find another escape route.</li>
        <li><strong>Stop, Drop, and Roll:</strong> If your clothes catch fire, stop where you are, drop to the ground, and roll back and forth to extinguish the flames.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Wet Cloth:</strong> Cover your nose and mouth with a wet cloth to help filter out smoke and fumes as you escape.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>After a Fire:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Check for Injuries:</strong> Provide first aid if necessary and seek medical attention for any injuries.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Out of the Building:</strong> Do not re-enter a building until it has been declared safe by authorities.</li>
        <li><strong>Report Damage:</strong> Contact your insurance company to report the damage and begin the claims process.</li>
        <li><strong>Seek Support:</strong> Reach out to local support services and community organizations for assistance and resources.</li>
    </ul>
